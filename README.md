# FaceEmotionRecognition

Facial expression recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness and so on. This model can be used for prediction of expressions of both still images and real time video. In case of real time video the image should be taken at any frame in time and feed it to the model for prediction of expression. The system automatically detects the face using HAAR cascade then its crops it and resize the image to a specific size and give it to the model for prediction.
